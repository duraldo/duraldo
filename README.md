- 👋 I'm @duraldo. Obviously name is Oscar from my email. This is just my old gamer tag until I get how github works.
      Yes, probably will make a new one, but this is for, class notes and to help others struggling. (Catch me on PSN if you want)
- 👀 LLMs and PLLMs, automation. Tearing PC's apart and glueing them back together with string, etc (thank you dad).
- 🌱 Python basics learning python, degree in Lingustics, you'd think this would make python easier. It does not, it does make the LLM and the PLLMs (AGI, AI, whatever buzzword) so easy to understand though!
- 💞️ Whatever wanting to get back into modding things again too.
- 📫 oscbissot@gmail.com (at the moment, please use this email).

- This is just a respository of notes/examples/answers for the crash course in python. Some may be similiar or even the same as others, but I added my own notes in the
- Like this, as my background makes it very difficult to understand how I even come across these answers, they just work!
- Seems for me, the best way to look at the questions on this course is word math problems (and I hated those in school, so yeah...)

- These are more or less answers I guess from the crash course, but with notes on my thinking process.
- I basically just booked and pen and paper my way through this, but if I can do it, you can learn python too!
- I'm just a security guard that litteray works in horse manure, you can do it to, just please don't copy the answers, use them as like a guide. (it didn't help me trying to get copy a code, because the
  The way I learn andI understand code and language is completely different. The videos and course materials do not help me much on the quizzes, books and other supplemental reading and practing does. So, re-taking 
  those graded  asssements are a good idea. I think I will put visual aids later for others.
  I'm sure some of you are looking for answers, they are here, I would not reccomend you using my anaswers, but use it as a guide. there are far better and simplier ways to answer the same quetion on these graded 
  assesments. Besides, many of those answers are technically wrong due to syntax errors. You do not ned chatGPT or AI to help. I did this in a stable barn with pen and paper without access, and a lot of trial an 
  error.

- ‼️ if anthing this should give encourangement to anyone struggling! You got it
