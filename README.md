- üëã I'm @duraldo. Obviously name is Oscar from my email. This is just my old gamer tag until I get how github works.
      Yes, probably will make a new one, but this is for, class notes and to help others struggling. (Catch me on PSN if you want)
- üå± Python basics learning python, degree in Lingustics, you'd think this would make python easier. It does not, it does make the LLM and the PLLMs (AGI, AI, whatever buzzword) so easy to understand though!
- üíûÔ∏è Whatever wanting to get back into modding things again too.
- üì´ oscbissot@gmail.com (at the moment, please use this email).

- This is just a respository of notes/examples/answers for the crash course in python. Some may be similiar or even the same as others, but I added my own notes in the
- Like this, as my background makes it very difficult to understand how I even come across these answers, they just work!
- Seems for me, the best way to look at the questions on this course is word math problems (and I hated those in school, so yeah...)

- Okay, this is what it was originally, the random files on the side, are answers and my notes from the crash course in python class. I wouldn't trust them fully. They're probably not right.

  Now, I'm working on FileScannerChaippy. Basically, it's a file scanner. Right now, all it does is bring up the top 10 files in the drive I have set to.

  - ROADMAP: Things to add immediatily for the nextversion. The one right now is the foundation:
 
  - Input/output
  - -scanning whole directories
  - file extenstion, customization
  - ... more still.
  - 
  - eventually I want to use rasa open sourse, or heck maybe even chatgpt api to implement a chatbot AI feature and go from there

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è if anthing this should give encourangement to anyone struggling! You got it, maybe you came across my other .py files stuck on a question or something idk.
